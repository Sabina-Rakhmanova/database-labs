This repository contains a full collection of PostgreSQL laboratory exercises created to help students develop a solid understanding of relational databases, SQL querying, and data management.
Each lab introduces key database concepts and practical SQL commands that demonstrate how real-world databases are designed, queried, and maintained â€” from creating tables and defining relationships to performing transactions, data imports, and backups.
